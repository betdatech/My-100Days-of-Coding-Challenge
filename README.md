# My-100Days-of-Coding-Challenge

A day to day update on my 100 Days coding challenge 

## Day 1
I am learning how to use the Print Statement
The print statement is how you get your program to put messages in the console.

The "" (quotes) are used to tell the command that you're putting text in there (any text you want)

A bunch of text (or whatever you put in quotes) is called a string.

I am also learning about the multiple print statement using the triple quote (""" """)
